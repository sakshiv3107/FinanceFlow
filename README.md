## 📖 Description

FinanceFlow is a local-first personal finance app that helps you track daily expenses, visualise spending patterns, and manage monthly budgets — all without an internet connection. Every rupee you log is stored directly on your device using Hive, so your data is always private, always available, and never lost between sessions.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Add & manage expenses** — log amount, category, date, time, and optional notes
- **Dashboard (Home)** — monthly total at a glance, recent transactions, category summary cards
- **Analytics** — line chart for daily spending, category breakdown, month-over-month comparison
- **Transaction history** — search by keyword, filter by type, swipe to delete with undo
- **Budget goals** — set per-category monthly limits with visual progress indicators
- **Smart alerts** — warning when any category crosses 80% of its budget
- **Budget insight on add** — real-time hint showing projected budget % while adding an expense
- **Dark / Light theme** — system-aware with manual toggle via segmented control
- **CSV export** — export all transactions for use in spreadsheets
- **Fully offline** — all data stored locally via Hive, no internet required
- **Persistent storage** — data survives app restarts, phone restarts, and updates

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK `>=3.0.0`
- Dart SDK `>=3.0.0`
- Android Studio or VS Code with the Flutter extension
- A connected device or emulator

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/financeflow.git
cd financeflow

# 2. Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# 3. Run code generation (freezed models + Hive adapters)
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# 4. Run the app in debug mode
flutter run
```

### Run on a physical device (release mode)

```bash
flutter run --release
```

## 💾 Data Persistence

FinanceFlow is **fully offline and locally persistent**. Here is how it works:

- On first launch, `main.dart` calls `Hive.initFlutter()` and opens two boxes: `expenses` and `budgets`
- Every write operation (`addExpense`, `deleteExpense`, `setBudget`) calls through to the Hive box immediately — data is written to disk synchronously
- On every subsequent launch, `ExpenseNotifier` and `BudgetNotifier` load their full state from the Hive box in their constructors:

```dart
ExpenseNotifier(this._repo) : super([]) {
  state = _repo.getAllExpenses(); // loads persisted data on startup
}
```

- Closing the app, restarting the phone, or updating the app **does not erase data**
- Data is only removed when the user explicitly deletes a transaction or uses "Clear all data" in Settings

---

## 🗺️ Navigation

Routes are defined in `lib/core/router.dart` using `go_router`:

| Route | Screen |
|---|---|
| `/` | DashboardScreen (Home) |
| `/add` | AddExpenseScreen |
| `/analytics` | AnalyticsScreen |
| `/history` | HistoryScreen |
| `/goals` | GoalsScreen (Goals) |
| `/settings` | SettingsScreen |

---




## 🧪 Testing

> Testing setup is planned for v1.1.0. Recommended strategy:

- **Unit tests** — `ExpenseRepository` CRUD, `budgetProgressProvider` ratio calculation, date grouping logic in History
- **Widget tests** — `AddExpenseScreen` form validation, `DashboardScreen` empty state
- **Integration tests** — full add → view → delete expense flow using `flutter_test` + `integration_test`

Run tests (once written):
```bash
flutter test
flutter test integration_test/
```

---

## 🚢 Deployment

### Android

```bash
flutter build apk --release
# Output: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

flutter build appbundle --release
# Output: build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

Upload the `.aab` to Google Play Console.

### iOS

```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode, set your signing team, and archive for App Store submission.

### Environment variables

No environment variables are required — the app is fully offline with no API keys or remote services.
